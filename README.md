# OpenGoldenSunWindows
Recreating Golden Sun's "windowing system" in C# using MonoGame

## Description
In preparation of the OpenGoldenSun (OGS) project going open-source (which could take anywhere from a day to 10 years from now), I'm teaching myself C# and MonoGame.

Since I'm planning on actually contributing to OGS I thought I'd find something to build that's Golden Sun related and might leave me with some code I might be able to reuse for the actual project. (Also, this might or might not be a desparate attempt at telling OGS he should open source his stuff - I confess nothing!).

Hence the idea to build a small window system to remake the windows present in the Golden Sun gba games - this allows me to get some practical experience using C# and MonoGame and learn some things about the internals of the game.

The code might be a bit messy and inefficient but right now the thing I care most about is making a flexible windowing system, based on MVC principles, that could be used to recreate all functionality of golden sun's GUIs.

## Progress
Right now there isn't much to do: I remade the status screen, you can cycle through characters by pressing left and right and you can change the window color using up and down.
